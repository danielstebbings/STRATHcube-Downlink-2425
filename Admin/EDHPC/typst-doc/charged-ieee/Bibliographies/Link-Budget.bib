	abstract = {Cubesats offer relatively lost-cost access to space. They are actively used for a wide range of scientific studies and technology development efforts. Small size, relatively low available power, and highly constrained cost have typically limited the radios on these satellites to low data rates. In this paper we present our first AeroCube 915 MHz software defined radio based on a Zynq processor and using Lime Micro transceiver developed to address the low-cost constraint while at the same time offering a state-of-the-art communications link. The radio supports a wide range of modulations and powerful error correction code capable of 10 Mbps. The coding and modulation can be adapted in real-time as the range from the ground station to the satellite changes to maximize downlink throughput.},

	abstract = {Small satellite communications recently entered a period of massive interest driven by the uprising commercial and civil space applications and motivated by various technological advances. Miniaturized satellites, known as CubeSats, are particularly attractive due to their low development and deployment costs which makes them very promising in playing a central role in the global wireless communication sector with numerous applications ranging from Earth imaging and space exploration to military applications. Moreover, constellations of CubeSats in low Earth orbits (LEOs) can meet the increasing demands of global-coverage low-cost high-speed flexible connectivity. However, this requires innovative solutions to overcome the significant challenges facing high-data-rate low-power space communications. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the design, protocols, and architectures of state-of-the-art CubeSat communication subsystems with a particular focus on their baseband structures. The literature is surveyed in detail to identify all design, testing, and demonstration stages as well as accurately describe the systems’ architectures and communication protocols. The reliability, performance, data rate, and power consumption of the reviewed systems are critically compared and evaluated to understand the limitations of existing CubeSat transceivers and identify directions of future developments. It is concluded that CubeSat communication subsystems still face many challenges, namely the development of energy-efficient high-speed transceivers that satisfy CubeSats’ cost, mass, size, and power constraints. Nevertheless, several directions for improvements are proposed such as the use of improved channel coding algorithms, Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), beamforming, advanced antennas, deployable solar panels, and transition to higher frequency bands. By providing a concrete summary of existing CubeSat on-board transceiver designs and critically evaluating their unique features and limitations as well as offering insights about potential improvements, the review should aid CubeSat developers, researchers, and companies to develop more efficient high data rate CubeSat transceivers.},

	abstract = {CubeSat in a low earth orbit primarily uses a UHF transmitter with a fixed RF output power. In this paper, the design of the CubeSat transmitter with adaptive power control ability is presented. The design drive is to optimise the SNR and overcome the variability of the propagation path length due to different ground station elevation angles by adjusting its transmitting power. The TVAC test is conducted to validate the performance of the adaptive function in the transmitter. The TVAC is used to emulate the satellite condition in an outer space environment. Four thermal cycles starting from +60°C to -20°C with less than 10-5Pa pressure condition are employed, which was conducted at the KIT CeNT, Japan. The transmitter was integrated inside the satellite structure as a complete CubeSat system. The output power of the transmitter is tested from 0.5W to 2W based on the proposed satellite adaptive mode. The frequency stability of the transmitter is monitored and complies with an average of 70\% below requirement, which is less than 2ppm. The results indicate that the RF output power is adjustable to operate as the proposed CubeSat adaptive transmitter in a thermal vacuum condition, which was first developed in Malaysia.},

	abstract = {The abundance of radio signals and their increasing number creates interferences on adjacent signals and sometimes, with co-channel communication. Jammers, which are operated by hackers or by military forces, are another source of smart and powerful interferences. This paper will discuss the effect of the continuous wave interference (CWI) on a radio communication receiver, specifically with the Digital Video Broadcasting for Satellite Second Generation (DVB-S2) communication standard. It investigates the general effect of the interference on a Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) signal over each part of the DVB-S2 receiver. It also focuses on the impact of the center frequency and power of the interference on the critical blocks of a DVB-S2 receiver. This study also tries to determine the deviation from the normal operation in the format of mathematical expressions and simulation results. Based on the obtained results, there is a vulnerability in the chain of the receiver’s blocks that allows a smart jammer to affect the device with low power interference. The notch filter is utilized as a solution to mitigate the interference. In addition, the effects of this technique on the system’s performance are studied. The simulation results show that there is a great improvement after CWI removal according to the Jamming to Signal Ratio (JSR), the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), and the Bit Error Rate (BER). In some cases, the JSR was reduced by 15 dB, the SNR was improved by 10 dB and BER also improved by 7 dB. However, the notch filter deletes some information from the original signal. This study introduces new ways to clarify the tradeoff between the amount of interference power reduction and removed bandwidth from the signal with notch filtering.},
