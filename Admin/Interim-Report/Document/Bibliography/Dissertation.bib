	shorttitle = {{DVB}-S2},
	abstract = {{DVB}-S2 is the second-generation specification for satellite broad-band applications, developed by the Digital Video Broadcasting ({DVB}) Project in 2003. The system is structured as a toolkit to allow the implementation of the following satellite applications: {TV} and sound broadcasting, interactivity (i.e., Internet access), and professional services, such as {TV} contribution links and digital satellite news gathering. It has been specified around three concepts: best transmission performance approaching the Shannon limit, total flexibility, and reasonable receiver complexity. Channel coding and modulation are based on more recent developments by the scientific community: low density parity check codes are adopted, combined with {QPSK}, 8PSK, 16APSK, and 32APSK modulations for the system to work properly on the nonlinear satellite channel. The framing structure allows for maximum flexibility in a versatile system and also synchronization in worst case configurations (low signal-to-noise ratios). Adaptive coding and modulation, when used in one-to-one links, then allows optimization of the transmission parameters for each individual user,dependant on path conditions. Backward-compatible modes are also available,allowing existing {DVB}-S integrated receivers-decoders to continue working during the transitional period. The paper provides a tutorial overview of the {DVB}-S2 system, describing its main features and performance in various scenarios and applications.},
