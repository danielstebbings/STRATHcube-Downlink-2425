	abstract = {DVB-S2 is the second-generation specification for satellite broad-band applications, developed by the Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) Project in 2003. The system is structured as a toolkit to allow the implementation of the following satellite applications: TV and sound broadcasting, interactivity (i.e., Internet access), and professional services, such as TV contribution links and digital satellite news gathering. It has been specified around three concepts: best transmission performance approaching the Shannon limit, total flexibility, and reasonable receiver complexity. Channel coding and modulation are based on more recent developments by the scientific community: low density parity check codes are adopted, combined with QPSK, 8PSK, 16APSK, and 32APSK modulations for the system to work properly on the nonlinear satellite channel. The framing structure allows for maximum flexibility in a versatile system and also synchronization in worst case configurations (low signal-to-noise ratios). Adaptive coding and modulation, when used in one-to-one links, then allows optimization of the transmission parameters for each individual user,dependant on path conditions. Backward-compatible modes are also available,allowing existing DVB-S integrated receivers-decoders to continue working during the transitional period. The paper provides a tutorial overview of the DVB-S2 system, describing its main features and performance in various scenarios and applications.},

NASA’s leveraging of commercial direct-to-Earth ground stations offers several benefits for the small satellite community, including lower cost, greater coverage, and increased technology infusion. In the fall of 2020, SCaN announced their intention to rely primarily on industry-provided communications services for missions close to Earth by 2030.},
